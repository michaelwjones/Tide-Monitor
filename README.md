## üöÄ Quick Start

### View the Data
Simply visit the live dashboard links above - no installation required!

### Development Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser for the main dashboard
3. Open `debug/index.html` for the debug interface
4. Or serve with a local HTTP server for development

### Deploy Firmware (Advanced)
1. Install Particle Workbench
2. Navigate to `backend/boron404x/`
3. Run `flash.bat` to deploy to your Particle Boron device

### Deploy Cloud Functions (Advanced)
1. Navigate to `backend/firebase-functions/`
2. Use `deploy-enrichment.bat` for NOAA data enrichment (always safe)
3. Use `deploy-matrix-pencil-v1.bat` for tidal analysis (costs money when enabled)
4. Use `tidal-analysis/functions/lstm/v1/deploy-lstm-v1.bat` for LSTM forecasting (requires model training)

## üìä Data Format

The system collects readings every minute with the following data points:

```json
{
  "t": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "w": 2438,
  "hp": 152,
  "he": 178,
  "wp": 2445,
  "we": 2431,
  "vs": 487,
  "ws": "8.7",
  "wd": "180",
  "gs": "12.3",
  "wm": "2.5"
}
```

### Sensor Data Fields
- `t`: Timestamp (ISO8601)
- `w`: Water level in mm (average method)
- `hp/he`: Wave heights using percentile/envelope methods
- `wp/we`: Water levels using percentile/envelope methods  
- `vs`: Valid sample count (out of 512)

### NOAA Environmental Data (added via Cloud Functions)
- `ws`: Wind speed in m/s from Duke Marine Lab
- `wd`: Wind direction in degrees from Duke Marine Lab  
- `gs`: Gust speed in m/s from Duke Marine Lab
- `wm`: Water level in feet (MLLW datum) from Duke Marine Lab

**Note**: NOAA fields show -999 when APIs are unavailable or data validation fails. The system uses the last element from NOAA data arrays because the API occasionally returns the whole day's data instead of just the latest reading.

## üîß Technical Details

### Wave Analysis Methods
1. **Percentile Method**: Uses statistical percentiles to calculate wave heights with cubic spline smoothing
2. **Envelope Method**: Available in debug dashboard for detailed analysis
   
### Main Dashboard Visualization
- **Smoothed Trend Lines**: All wave and wind data uses 30-point progressive smoothing
- **Cubic Spline Interpolation**: Natural splines with Thomas algorithm for optimal performance
- **Unit Conversion**: Wind speed converted from m/s to knots (1 m/s = 1.94384 knots)
- **Error Filtering**: Automatically excludes NOAA API failure values (-999)

### Advanced Trend Line Analysis

#### Water Level Harmonics (Matrix Pencil Method)
- **Mathematical Form**: `f(t) = Œ£ A‚Çñ e^(œÉ‚Çñ + jœâ‚Çñ)t` (complex exponential decomposition)
- **Signal Components**: Up to 8 components with automatic model order selection via SVD
- **Matrix Pencil Analysis**: Advanced signal processing for non-periodic tidal data
- **Frequency Detection**: Detects multiple tidal constituents simultaneously (M2 ~12.4h, S2 ~12.0h, K1 ~23.9h, O1 ~25.8h)
- **Non-Periodic Capability**: Handles real-world tidal variations without periodicity assumptions
- **SVD-Based Selection**: Automatic component selection using 1% singular value threshold
- **Amplitude & Damping**: Estimates both oscillation amplitude and damping coefficients
- **Full Chart Coverage**: Trend lines span entire display range with no edge artifacts

#### Wind/Wave Cubic Splines
- **Enhanced Smoothing**: Progressive 1-30 point moving averages (16 smoothing levels)
- **Algorithm**: Natural cubic splines with Thomas algorithm (O(n) complexity)
- **Edge Protection**: Prevents oscillation artifacts at data boundaries
- **Dynamic Window**: Adaptive smoothing based on distance from edges
- **Superior Noise Reduction**: 30-point averaging for highly variable environmental data

### Failed Analysis Methods
**Binning Method** (Removed): This method grouped readings into bins for wave analysis but was removed due to:
- **Higher Erratic Behavior**: Produced more inconsistent results compared to percentile and envelope methods
- **Lower Resolution**: Provided less precise measurements due to the binning approach
- **Poor Signal Quality**: The discrete nature of binning introduced artifacts that degraded wave height calculations

### Data Processing
- **Noise Reduction**: 512 samples averaged per reading
- **Outlier Filtering**: Invalid readings (outside 300-5000mm) are discarded
- **Offline Storage**: Up to 1000 readings stored locally when connectivity is lost
- **Cloud Sync**: Automatic upload when connection is restored

### Advanced Analytics
- **Dual Methodology Trend Analysis**: Unified interface with specialized algorithms
  - **Water Levels**: Matrix Pencil signal analysis for non-periodic tidal reconstruction
  - **Wind/Wave Data**: Enhanced 30-point smoothed cubic splines
- **LSTM Neural Network Forecasting**: 24-hour predictive modeling
  - **Iterative Architecture**: 72-hour input sequences generate 1,440 future predictions
  - **Machine Learning**: PyTorch-trained LSTM with 2-layer, 128-unit architecture
  - **Cloud Inference**: ONNX deployment on Firebase Functions with 6-hour update cycle
  - **Visual Integration**: Dashed orange forecast lines extending 24 hours beyond current data
- **Model Validation**: Analysis Error plot shows residuals (measured - predicted + 1 offset)
  - **Quality Assessment**: Visual feedback on Matrix Pencil reconstruction accuracy
  - **Error Distribution**: Reveals systematic biases or random errors in tidal modeling
  - **Real-time Validation**: Updates automatically with each analysis refresh
- **Performance Optimized**: Cached Matrix Pencil results prevent duplicate computation
- **Edge-Safe**: Matrix Pencil reconstruction covers full chart range without artifacts
- **Toggle Control**: Single button controls both trend line methodologies
- **Visual Distinction**: Matrix Pencil uses thick dashed lines, splines use standard dashing

### Security & Performance
- **Content Security Policy**: Protection against XSS attacks
- **Optimized Rendering**: Chart animations disabled for performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when data is unavailable
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Fast Trend Lines**: Cached Matrix Pencil analysis with full 4318-sample processing, cubic splines under 150ms
