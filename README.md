## üöÄ Quick Start

### View the Data
Simply visit the live dashboard links above - no installation required!

### Development Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser for the main dashboard
3. Open `debug/index.html` for the debug interface
4. Or serve with a local HTTP server for development

### Deploy Firmware (Advanced)

## üìä Data Format

The system collects readings every minute with the following data points:

```json
{
  "t": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "w": 2438,
  "hp": 152,
  "he": 178,
  "wp": 2445,
  "we": 2431,
  "vs": 487,
  "ws": "8.7",
  "wd": "180",
  "gs": "12.3",
  "wm": "2.5"
}
```

### Sensor Data Fields
- `t`: Timestamp (ISO8601)
- `w`: Water level in mm (average method)
- `hp/he`: Wave heights using percentile/envelope methods
- `wp/we`: Water levels using percentile/envelope methods  
- `vs`: Valid sample count (out of 512)

### NOAA Environmental Data (added via Cloud Functions)
- `ws`: Wind speed in m/s from Duke Marine Lab
- `wd`: Wind direction in degrees from Duke Marine Lab  
- `gs`: Gust speed in m/s from Duke Marine Lab
- `wm`: Water level in feet (MLLW datum) from Duke Marine Lab

## üîß Technical Details

### Wave Analysis Methods
1. **Percentile Method**: Uses statistical percentiles to calculate wave heights with cubic spline smoothing
2. **Envelope Method**: Available in debug dashboard for detailed analysis
   
### Main Dashboard Visualization
- **Smoothed Trend Lines**: All wave and wind data uses 30-point progressive smoothing
- **Cubic Spline Interpolation**: Natural splines with Thomas algorithm for optimal performance
- **Unit Conversion**: Wind speed converted from m/s to knots (1 m/s = 1.94384 knots)
- **Error Filtering**: Automatically excludes NOAA API failure values (-999)

### Advanced Trend Line Analysis

#### Water Level Harmonics
- **Mathematical Form**: `f(t) = a0 + a1*sin(a2*t + a3)`
- **Coefficients**: 4 parameters (DC offset, amplitude, frequency, phase)
- **FFT-Based Detection**: Automatic tidal period discovery from 72 hours of data
- **Frequency Range**: 6-48 hour periods with 30-minute resolution
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects dominant tidal constituents automatically
- **Least Squares Fitting**: Robust amplitude and phase calculation
- **Tidal Classification**: Automatic identification of diurnal, semi-diurnal, and harmonic components

#### Wind/Wave Cubic Splines
- **Enhanced Smoothing**: Progressive 1-30 point moving averages (16 smoothing levels)
- **Algorithm**: Natural cubic splines with Thomas algorithm (O(n) complexity)
- **Edge Protection**: Prevents oscillation artifacts at data boundaries
- **Dynamic Window**: Adaptive smoothing based on distance from edges
- **Superior Noise Reduction**: 30-point averaging for highly variable environmental data

### Failed Analysis Methods
**Binning Method** (Removed): This method grouped readings into bins for wave analysis but was removed due to:
- **Higher Erratic Behavior**: Produced more inconsistent results compared to percentile and envelope methods
- **Lower Resolution**: Provided less precise measurements due to the binning approach
- **Poor Signal Quality**: The discrete nature of binning introduced artifacts that degraded wave height calculations

### Data Processing
- **Noise Reduction**: 512 samples averaged per reading
- **Outlier Filtering**: Invalid readings (outside 300-5000mm) are discarded
- **Offline Storage**: Up to 1000 readings stored locally when connectivity is lost
- **Cloud Sync**: Automatic upload when connection is restored

### Advanced Analytics
- **Dual Methodology Trend Analysis**: Unified interface with specialized algorithms
  - **Water Levels**: FFT-based harmonic analysis with automatic tidal detection
  - **Wind/Wave Data**: Enhanced 30-point smoothed cubic splines
- **Performance Optimized**: O(n) complexity using Thomas algorithm for fast rendering
- **Edge-Safe**: Natural splines prevent oscillation artifacts at data boundaries
- **Toggle Control**: Single button controls both trend line methodologies
- **Visual Distinction**: Harmonics use thick dashed lines, splines use standard dashing

### Security & Performance
- **Content Security Policy**: Protection against XSS attacks
- **Optimized Rendering**: Chart animations disabled for performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when data is unavailable
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Fast Trend Lines**: Harmonic computation under 100ms, cubic splines under 150ms for 4320 data points
- **Automatic Tidal Analysis**: FFT-based period detection with comprehensive frequency table
