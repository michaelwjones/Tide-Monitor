# Transformer v3 Model Architecture

## Overview

Transformer v3 is the next iteration of our encoder-only transformer for tidal water level prediction. Building on the v2 foundation, v3 introduces modifications to the data structure and model architecture.

## Architecture Design

### Model Type
- **Architecture**: Encoder-only Transformer
- **Prediction Method**: Direct single-pass (no autoregressive generation)
- **Data Sets**: 3 distinct data sets (expanded from v2's 2 sets)

## Key Changes from v2

- Modified to handle 3 data sets instead of 2
- Additional architectural improvements to be implemented

## Development Status

This is a work-in-progress version based on transformer v2. Core implementation details will be updated as development progresses.
